# CommunalTable, an web-application that connects you to community through food.

##A project developed for SI 660: Experimental Social Computing Systems

Communal Table is built with Python using a Flask framework that connects to a SQL database.

In order to run this project, activate the virtual environment env1 in your console (specifically within the CommunalTable_Web directory) using the following command : `source env1/bin/activate`

You may need to pip install packages specified on the requirements.txt

Once your virtual environment is activated, you can then run a local server with the command: `python app.py`
